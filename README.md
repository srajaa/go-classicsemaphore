# go-classicsemaphore
This package provides an implementation of classical operating systems semaphores in golang. The operations supported are P() and V() and there is no bound allowing one to implement traditional producer consumer patterns without blocking the producer. Operating systems like Windows and Linux support classical semaphores both in user and kernel mode.
